# Programming for Data Analytics

## Introduction
This repository has been created as part of the *Programming for Data Analytics* module for the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics at ATU. The module introduces essential programming techniques and tools for effective data analysis, with a strong emphasis on practical applications. This README follows GitHub's guidelines for documentation. For more details on writing in Markdown, refer to [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github).

## Getting Started
This repository contains my assessment submissions, showcasing the skills developed throughout the semester in data analysis and programming. It includes:
- Practical assignments
- The final project

All resources and sample code for this module are available in the course's GitHub repository: [PFDA Courseware GitHub Repository](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware.git).

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this module, learners will be able to:
1. Programmatically create plots and other visual outputs from data.
2. Design algorithms to solve numerical problems.
3. Develop software that incorporates and utilizes standard numerical libraries.
4. Employ appropriate data structures for data-intensive applications.

## Practical Assignments
### Assignment 2: Weather
**Task Description:** Create a Jupyter Notebook (`assignment2-weather.ipynb`) to plot temperature trends over time using the "dryBulbTemperature_Celsius" field.

**Summary:**
- **Data Loading:** Imported a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Converted the `reportStartDateTime` column into a datetime format for time-based plotting.
- **Plotting:** Created both a scatter plot and a line plot of temperature over time, including custom labels, grids, and titles.
- **Output:** Generated an informative and visually appealing temperature trend plot.

### Other Assignments
Each practical assignment builds on foundational skills. Topics include:
- **Representing Data:** Understanding CSV and JSON formats.
- **Plotting:** Using Matplotlib for data visualization.
- **Data Manipulation:** Utilizing Pandas for reading, writing, and transforming data.
- **Random Data Generation:** Using NumPy for pseudo-random data and distributions.

## Final Project
The final project involves creating a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate the learning outcomes from the module. If no specific area of interest is chosen, the suggested topic is to analyze wind speed data for wind farms.

**Deadline:** 13th January 2025
