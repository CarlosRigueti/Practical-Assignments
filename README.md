# Programming for Data Analytics

## Introduction
This repository has been created as part of the *Programming for Data Analytics* module for the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics at ATU. The module introduces essential programming techniques and tools for effective data analysis, with a strong emphasis on practical applications. This README follows GitHub's guidelines for documentation. For more details on writing in Markdown, refer to [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github).

## Getting Started
This repository contains my assessment submissions, showcasing the skills developed throughout the semester in data analysis and programming. It includes:
- Practical assignments
- The final project

All resources and sample code for this module are available in the course's GitHub repository: [PFDA Courseware GitHub Repository](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware.git).

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this module, learners will be able to:
1. Programmatically create plots and other visual outputs from data.
2. Design algorithms to solve numerical problems.
3. Develop software that incorporates and utilizes standard numerical libraries.
4. Employ appropriate data structures for data-intensive applications.

## Practical Assignments
### Assignment 2: Weather
**Task Description:** Create a Jupyter Notebook (`assignment2-weather.ipynb`) to plot temperature trends over time using the "dryBulbTemperature_Celsius" field.

**Summary:**
- **Data Loading:** Imported a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Converted the `reportStartDateTime` column into a datetime format for time-based plotting.
- **Plotting:** Created both a scatter plot and a line plot of temperature over time, including custom labels, grids, and titles.
- **Output:** Generated an informative and visually appealing temperature trend plot.

### Other Assignments
Each practical assignment builds on foundational skills. Topics include:
- **Representing Data:** Understanding CSV and JSON formats.
- **Plotting:** Using Matplotlib for data visualization.
- **Data Manipulation:** Utilizing Pandas for reading, writing, and transforming data.
- **Random Data Generation:** Using NumPy for pseudo-random data and distributions.

## Final Project
### Analysis of Citizenship Applications in Ireland (2017-2024)

The dataset analyzed in this case is sourced from Data.gov.ie, a platform that provides access to publicly available government data in Ireland. The specific dataset used here is titled Citizenship Applications and Decisions by Year and Nationality, and it spans the period from 2017 to 2024. This dataset includes detailed information on the number of citizenship applications received by the Irish government each year, along with the corresponding number of citizenship certificates issued.

The data is organized by nationality, with separate columns for the years 2017 to 2024. For each nationality, the dataset records both the applications that were "Received" and those that were "Issued." This structure allows for a detailed analysis of citizenship application trends over time, as well as insights into how different nationalities have engaged with the Irish naturalization process.

The dataset was collected by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), which is responsible for processing citizenship applications. It is regularly updated to reflect changes in the number of applications received and the status of those applications. The information in the dataset is publicly available for analysis, offering transparency into the workings of the Irish immigration system and providing a valuable resource for understanding immigration patterns and trends in the country.
